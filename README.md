###Exercism Exercises!

Did I just realise where the name of the website came from? Yes. Yes I did.

http://exercism.io/ is a site that gives you a set of tests that you have to create a program for, things like determining if a year is a leap year, that kind of jazz.

This repo has all of my answers, as well as the tests and requirements for each problem.
